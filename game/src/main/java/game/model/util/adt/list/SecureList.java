/**
 * SecureList is an indirect extension of the list class.
 * 
 * There are two special new features:
 * 	1) Closed Actions
 * 	2) Transactions
 * 
 * 1) Closed Actions:
 * If the current element of the list is to be maintained after a performed 
 * action which passes the list start-closed-action before the action and 
 * call end-closed-action afterwards.
 * 
 * During the closed action it is impossible to remove items out of the list
 * and to add items to list but it is only possible to pass the list
 * by using next and previous methods and to check the current element.
 * 
 * 2) Transactions:
 * If no other operation except of children of the current transaction
 * shell be able to change the state of the list, the method start-transaction
 * is called before the action and end-transaction afterwards.
